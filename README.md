# Dataset Overview
The colors.json file is a crucial part of our project, serving as the backbone for the color palette functionalities, including the search feature and the colorPalette component. This JSON dataset contains a curated list of colors, each with details regarding its name, hexadecimal code.
# Structure
[
  {
    "name": "INDIANRED",
    "hex": "#CD5C5C",
    "rgb": "RGB(205, 92, 92)",
    "families": ["red", "brown"]
  },
  {
    "name": "LIGHTCORAL",
    "hex": "#F08080",
    "rgb": "RGB(240, 128, 128)",
    "families": ["red", "pink", "coral", "light"]
  }
]

# Usage
This dataset powers the SearchPage and ColorPalette components, allowing users to explore and find colors based on name or hex code. If modifications are made to the dataset structure, corresponding updates must be applied to these components to ensure consistency and functionality.
